- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Vladimir Melekhin and I'm 23 years old. I'm a Unity/C# developer at [GearGames](https://gear-games.com/).

I used to study at [Ecole 42](https://www.42.fr/) until I switched to making what I love - games.

I'm currently using Unity/C# and constantly improving my programming skills.
